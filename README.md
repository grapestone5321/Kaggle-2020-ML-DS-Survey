### Overview
For the fourth year, Kaggle surveyed its community of data enthusiasts to share trends within a quickly growing field. 

### Based on responses from 20,036 Kaggle members, we’ve created this report focused on the 13% (2,675 respondents) who are currently employed as data scientists

We can see a clear picture of what is common in the community but also the diverse attributes of its members.

## submission
To make a submission, complete the submission form. 

Only one submission will be judged per participant, so if you make multiple submissions we will review the last (most recent) entry.

### Submissions will be evaluated on the following:

- Composition - Is there a clear narrative thread to the story that’s articulated and supported by data? 

The subject should be well defined, well researched, and well supported through the use of data and visualizations.

- Originality - Does the reader learn something new through this submission? 

Or is the reader challenged to think about something in a new way? 

A great entry will be informative, thought provoking, and fresh all at the same time.

- Documentation - Are your code, and notebook, and additional data sources well documented so a reader can understand what you did? 

Are your sources clearly cited? 

A high quality analysis should be concise and clear at each step so the rationale is easy to follow and the process is reproducible
